        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I spent both the Summer of 2017 and Summer 2018 living in Tel Aviv and learning about impactful Israeli innovationss. When I heard about the incredible success of the Israel Summit at Harvard (2017), I knew I needed to bring this initiative to Michigan's campus. I quickly joined forces with two other students to create the Israel Summmit at Michigan, where I served as co-Founder and co-Director.

After the morning keynote speakers, students engaged in a Special Opportunities Fair, where there was information about different types of trips to Israel for people of all backgrounds. In the afternoon attendees heard from Noam Gershony, a former IDF Pilot, who become a gold medal Paralympian after being injured, Brendan Tuohey, CEO of PeacePlayers International, Allyson Greenfield, Executive Director of the Israel Cancer Research Fund in Chicago, and Neil Schwartz, a representative from IsraAid.
